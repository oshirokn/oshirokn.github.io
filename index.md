Plan your moves carefully, each mistake is fatal! Who will you kill first? Who will you become?``

Tech: Unity HDRP

As lead designer my major contributions consisted of the following:
- devised the game mechanics and character abilities
- wrote the game design document
- crafted puzzle designs on a whiteboard
- implemented levels inside Unity
- iterated on the game mechanics and puzzles, including testing during external events (IGDA meetups)
- implemented the visual effects to convey the necessary information to the player (UX design)
- deciding the narrative design and consistency between levels
