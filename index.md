# Ken Oshiro

I am a game designer and producer with 3 years of experience, currently studying at Aalto University to obtain a Master's Degree in Game Design and Production.
I specialize in gameplay, game economy and player progression.

I graduated with a MSc in Economics.

My game projects have won awards in 3 competitions, both for PC and mobile. I strive to create games with original game mechanics and/or feel.
