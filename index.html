      <h2>Fantasy – Epic Tragedy</h2>
      <p>In empires powered by soul magic, there are no gods, only myths forged to sanctify murder.<br><br>
      Elysia comes of age untouched but owned, trained as ornament and remembrance.  
      Lucius, a fading mage, and Eris, his silent protégé, must kill the innocent to escape the fate carved for them—or complete it.<br><br>
      A curse has been prepared. Casting it will end everything that still remembers.</p>

      <h2>Sci-Fi – Political Fiction</h2>
      <p>Earth is gone, burned from the sky.<br><br>
      What remains of mankind lives underground, watched by its own sins.  
      The stars above are silent. No one knows if silence means peace, or extinction.<br><br>
      Ashlin, a tunneler—“rock bitch,” in her own words—endures the Siege Directive’s doctrine of endless preparation.  
      But how do you defy extinction, when survival was the first mistake?<br><br>
      Glory to Mankind.</p>

      <h2>War – Speculative Realism</h2>
      <p>A genocidal war burns in the forgotten borderlands of the Veligrad Federation.  
      Artem, 19, conscripted and already broken, is sent to the siege of the separatist capital—where ideals go to die.<br><br>
      Across the mountains, the neutral Republic of Seleneraad mobilizes its reserves. Not to intervene.  
      Just to keep the refugees out.</p>
